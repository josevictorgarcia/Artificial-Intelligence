- FaceRecognitionV1: Contains a basic program in Python that recognizes human faces using the OpenCV library and the face_recognition module.

      Its purpose is to make a first approach to learning the face recognition basics at a high-level programming as well as getting familiar with Python.

      In order to use the program two folders need to be added to the FaceRecognitionV1 folder:
  
      1. Folder named "Known_Identities": Containing images (.jpg format) of ONE SINGLE PERSON (as though it is an official ID picture). If possible, name the image in such way that it would be easy for you to find it, for example with the ID number (e.g: 00000023T).
  
      2. Folder named "Unknown_Identities": Containing images(.jpg format) of UNKNOWN PEOPLE (can be none or many unidentified people in the image). The program will compare all the known identities faces with all the unknown people in each picture. The output of the program will be each picture with the unknown identities framed in green if recognized.

      NOTE: It may not work for windows users. If so, try changing the path of the folders within the program code.
